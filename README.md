Program Instructions:
-----

Simply press the "Start" button and a transparent proxy server will be started on port 8888 on your host machine. Then, connect to the proxy on any device that has GoGuardian installed and restart the device.

NoGuardian prevents any attempts that GoGuardian makes to send and retrieve data from its servers including but not limited to:

 - Retrieving the url and keyword blacklist required for blocking functionality
 - Checking for current classroom sessions
 - Sending screenshots of your web-browser to your current classroom session
 - Executing routine IP address checks on your device

**Note:** This program was created as a fun challenge for myself and is meant to demonstrate a near universal functioning bypass for GoGuardian. I am not responsible for how you choose to use my software.
